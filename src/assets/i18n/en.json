      "line3": "In the past years we both spent our everyday life in Pécs, so it was clear for us to look for a location close to this city. This way we can not only manage the wedding more easily, but we also managed to find a place that meets another very important need of ours, which is to be close to nature and be quiet at the same time.",
      "line4": "This location is close to Szigetvár and meets all of our expectations.",
      "line5": "As for the date, it is important for us that it is neither too cold nor too hot, so April was the right choice.",
