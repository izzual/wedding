      "line3": "In the past years we both spent our everyday life in Pécs, so it was clear for us to look for a location close to this city. This way we can not only manage the wedding more easily, but we also managed to find a place that meets another very important need of ours, which is to be close to nature and be quiet at the same time.",
      "line4": "This location is close to Szigetvár and meets all of our expectations.",
      "line5": "As for the date, it is important for us that it is neither too cold nor too hot, so April was the right choice.",
      "line6": "To make the big day as memorable as possible, we wanted to have professional help, so we hired a wedding organizer who not only guides us through the whole process, but also became our master of ceremonies on the big day.",
      "line7": "However, there are also many of you who helped and still are helping, for example by recommending a photographer, helping to choose the dress, giving ideas or contributing to the website.",

      "line1": "This Catholic church is one of the two mosques in Szigetvár. The church is located on Zrínyi Square, a building that is in many ways not ordinary. Its layout is different from the usual, and its arched windows are a reference to its oriental past. After the conquest of Szigetvár, Müezzinzade Ali began to build the church, then a mosque. Ali Pasha was killed in 1571, but the mosque continued to be built and was completed by 1589. For a hundred years afterwards, until the recapture of Szigetvár, it was a Muslim place of worship.",
      "line2": "The mosque was first used as a gunpowder storage, then in 1788 it was consecrated as a Catholic church in honor of St. Rocco and altered inside and out. The minaret next to the building was destroyed by lightning in 1715. Both the entrance hall and the dome were dismantled and the arched windows were converted into baroque ones.",
      "line3": "The church was renovated in the 1980s, retaining the Turkish style features, which include arched windows and stalactite decorations in the corners of the interior.",
      "line4": "In the dome there is a Baroque fresco by István Dorffmeister. The font is from the former Turkish baths."
